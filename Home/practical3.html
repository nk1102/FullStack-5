        Full stack development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.
        In nowadays trends MNC's are recuriting most of the full stack developers and in pandemic time the jobs of full stack web developers were increased.
        Full stack web development is the better option nowadays as companies don't want to hire front end and back end developers as in most of the cases their is lack of coordination.
